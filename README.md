Rich Media Display Object
This project was passed from hand to hand from about 2007 to 2010 before I took stewardship.  This object controls display for expandable media and collection of anonymous data to be displayed in aggregate.  It supports Flash SWF or .htm for input and is part of the Conversant Ad Server.
